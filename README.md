**• i'll mainly be in my soulbond skins in the proship tree. You will NOT see this account linked if im in the CRK, LMK, LS/MCYT area (i value my sanity soo no death threats from you goofy people soo womp womp 🫵)**

**• dont even bother talking to me about fandom discourse- i have bigger things to worry about than what ppl do in online spaces- i'd rather do that on a diff platform than ponytown. I quite literally do not care if you are a proshipper or an anti but i will step in if i see some rando harrassing people in a pixel pony game (if you think you're so cool for that then you're not.. you just look stupid and annoying)**

**• Interacting, cuddling, hiding is perfectly fine! :3**

**• very akward- if i suddenly go quiet during a conversation i just dont know what else to say KSJKAJS- just dont be rude and were good!!**

**• if you mention any ships related to my f/os i'll block you (nothing personal- just comfort stuff)**

**• Dont send friend requests if we didnt interact much- it floods my list**

**• If you recognize me from tumblr feel free to say hi! :D**
