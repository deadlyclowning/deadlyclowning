<strong> ${\textsf{\color{#f46b1b} ‚Ä¢ IF YOU POST ANY SHIPS RELATED TO REDSON }}$ 

> **i am VERY possesive over redson. I do nooot feel comfortable any ships with him (that sadly includes other selfships)**

> Since some people dont know how to read apparently!! I am not claiming him as a character. I dont give a flying fuck if you have him as an alter or whatever- im only ***UNCOMFORTABLE*** with ships about him ***BECAUSE I AM POSSESIVE OVER HIM***. There's a reason why i have that dni thing there and its for my own personal comfort- i will literally block tags on tumblr related to him in ships ***FOR THAT EXACT REASON***. My version of redson is a soulbond that formed in 2 years of watching the show meaning he is different ***FROM HIS SOURCE- HE IS A DIFFERENT VERSION OF HIS CANON SELF*** MEANING HE IS UNIQUE TO MY OWN SYSTEM. There are different redsons in the world and all of them are valid and i am NOT claiming them since they are not in MY system. So kindly shut the fuck up and learn how to actually read for once in your life!!!
