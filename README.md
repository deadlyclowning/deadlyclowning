• dont even bother talking to me about fandom discourse- i have bigger things to worry about than what ppl do in online spaces- i'd rather do that on a diff platform than ponytown. I quite literally do not care if you are a proshipper or an anti but i will step in if i see some rando harrassing people in a pixel pony game (bro go outside and touch grass if you do that /srs if you think you're so cool for that then you're not.. you just look silly)

• I don't mind people cuddling or interacting! :3

• Will gladly have a conversation! just dont be rude and were good!!

• do avoid involving me in roleplays related to lifesteal or anything clownpierce related- im a new fan of this whole thing and idk much about the fandom KLSJKHJ

<strong> ${\textsf{\color{#f99fa1} • IF YOU POST ANY SHIPS RELATED TO REDSON }}$ 

> **i am VERY possesive over redson. I do nooot feel comfortable any ships with him (that sadly includes other selfships)**

> Since some people dont know how to read apparently!! I am not claiming him as a character. I dont give a flying fuck if you have him as an alter or whatever- im only ***UNCOMFORTABLE*** with ships about him ***BECAUSE I AM POSSESIVE OVER HIM***. There's a reason why i have that dni thing there and its for my own personal comfort- i will literally block tags on tumblr related to him in ships ***FOR THAT EXACT REASON***. My version of redson is a soulbond that formed in 2 years of watching the show meaning he is different ***FROM HIS SOURCE- HE IS A DIFFERENT VERSION OF HIS CANON SELF*** MEANING HE IS UNIQUE TO MY OWN SYSTEM. There are different redsons in the world and all of them are valid and i am NOT claiming them since they are not in MY system. So kindly shut the fuck up and learn how to actually read for once in your life!!!

> adding onto this- i dont care if you ship redson with other characters! i cant control that obviously. That mainly applies on tumblr or if you talk about it to me directly
