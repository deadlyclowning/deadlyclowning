</h2 div> 

• i'll mainly be in my redson or cosplay skins hanging out near the TCOAAL, mcyt/ls, proship area, or any other places with my cosplays :3

• dont even bother talking to me about fandom discourse- i have bigger things to worry about than what ppl do in online spaces- i'd rather do that on a diff platform than ponytown. I quite literally do not care if you are a proshipper or an anti but i will step in if i see some rando harrassing people in a pixel pony game (bro go outside and touch grass if you do that /srs if you think you're so cool for that then you're not.. you just look silly)

• I don't mind people cuddling or interacting! :3

• Will gladly have a conversation! just dont be rude and were good!!

• do avoid involving me in roleplays related to lifesteal or anything clownpierce related- im a new fan of this whole thing and idk much about the fandom KLSJKHJ
