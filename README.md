• i'll mainly be in my redson or cosplay skins hanging out near the mcyt/ls, proship tree, or any other places with my cosplays. You will NOT see this account linked if im in the CRK area (i value my sanity soo no death threats from you goobers) :3

• dont even bother talking to me about fandom discourse- i have bigger things to worry about than what ppl do in online spaces- i'd rather do that on a diff platform than ponytown. I quite literally do not care if you are a proshipper or an anti but i will step in if i see some rando harrassing people in a pixel pony game (bro go outside and touch grass if you do that /srs if you think you're so cool for that then you're not.. you just look silly)

• Interacting, cuddling, hiding is perfectly fine! :3

• Will gladly have a conversation! just dont be rude and were good!!

• do avoid involving me in roleplays related to lifesteal or anything clownpierce related- im a new fan of this whole thing and idk much about the fandom KLSJKHJ
